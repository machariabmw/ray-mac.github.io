		My favourite story book upto date is <b><i>Seth The Silly Gorilla.</b></i>
		Of all the books I have read, this is the funniest and with lots of humor.
		I read it first when I was in class 8. I read it in 2010 when I visited my
		family at Murang'a town.

			<p style="font-family:times new roman; font-size:11px">During my primary school, there were no counties nor devolved 
			governance. The entire state was headed by the national government. It was otherwise associated with less cases
			 of corruption. The various locations of governance were in a specific hierachy as shown below.</p>
			 <ol start="01">
			 <li>Village - headed by elders</li>
			 <li>Sub-location - headed by sub-chie</li>
			 <li>Location - headed by chief</li>
			 <li>Division - headed by District Officer (D.O)</li>
			 <li>District - headed by District Commissioner (D.C)</li>
			 <li>Province - headed by Provincial Commissioner</li>
			 <li>Country/State/Nation - Headed by President</li>

			<p style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy"/>Today, the cases of corruption are too much. The devolution has done more harm than good. 
			Even the M.C.As and the Governors and Senators are doing nothing apart from looting and 
			embezzling public funds. The other public funds embezzers are the Women Rep's. NKT!:(</p>
